#  Sales Record Manager

This is a simple Python project I built to manage sales records using CSV files.  
It runs in the terminal and lets you add, update, delete, view, and summarize sales.  
I also added a chart using pandas and matplotlib to visualize sales by date.

# How is it useful in real life
- Instead of writing sales in notebooks or Excel, shopkeepers can use your program to record daily transactions, track totals, and avoid mistakes.
- Owners can see which products sell the most, which days are busiest, and make smarter decisions (like stocking more of popular items).
-  Instead of manually calculating totals, charts, or summaries, the program does it instantly — saving time and reducing human error.

# More Future Improvements
- Export Options → Allow users to export reports in formats like PDF, Excel, or JSON for sharing.
- Search & Filter → Add advanced search by product name, date range, or price range.
- User Authentication → Create login accounts so multiple users can manage sales securely.
