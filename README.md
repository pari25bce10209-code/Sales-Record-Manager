#  Sales Record Manager

## Overview
This is a simple Python project I built to manage sales records using CSV files.  
It runs in the terminal and lets you add, update, delete, view, and summarize sales.  
I also added a chart using pandas and matplotlib to visualize sales by date.

## Features
- Add a new sale (product, quantity, price, date)  
- Update an existing sale  
- Delete a sale  
- View all sales  
- Sort sales by date  
- Show summary report (total sales + best seller)  
- Generate a chart of sales by date  


## Tools Used
- **Python 3**  
- **pandas** → for data handling and analysis  
- **matplotlib** → for chart visualization  
- **CSV files** → for storing sales records

## Steps to install & run the project
- Clone the repository
- Open your terminal and run:
git clone
- Navigate into the project folder: cd Sales-Record-Manager
- Install the required libraries
Make sure to have Python 3 installed, then install dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib.:pip install pandas matplotlib
- Run the program
Start the application by running:
 python main.py
the program will open in terminal and we can add, update, delete, and view sales records, and generate charts with one command.

## Instructions for testing
- Firstly,the main menu will display with options like Add Sale, Update Sale, Delete Sale, View Sales, Show Summary, and Show Chart.
- Enter your choice
    Type the number of the option you want (for example, 1 to add a new sale).
    The program will then ask for the required details (like product name, quantity, price, and date).
- Perform your action
- If you add a sale, it will be saved in the sales.csv file.
- If you update or delete, the changes will be reflected immediately.
- If you choose to view or sort, all records will be displayed in the terminal.
- Generate reports and charts
   - Select the summary option to see total sales and best‑selling product.
   - Select the chart option to view a bar graph of sales by date.
- Exit when done
   Choose the exit option from the menu to safely close the program.
