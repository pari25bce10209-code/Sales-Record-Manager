# Statement

##  Problem Statement
Managing personal expenses manually can be time‑consuming, error‑prone, and lacks clear insights into spending habits. Users often struggle to track daily expenditures, categorize them effectively, and visualize where their money goes. Without a simple tool, budgeting and financial awareness become difficult.

##  Scope of the Project
The project aims to build a lightweight, user‑friendly Expense Manager application that:
- Records daily expenses with essential details (date, category, amount, note).
- Stores data in a structured format (CSV file).
- Provides visualization of spending patterns through charts.
- Offers a simple menu‑driven interface for easy interaction.

This scope is limited to personal expense tracking and visualization, not advanced financial forecasting or multi‑user support.

##  Target Users
- College Students who want to monitor pocket money or allowances.
- Working professionals tracking monthly budgets.
- Families managing household expenses.
- Anyone seeking a simple tool to record and visualize spending without complex accounting software.

##  High‑Level Features
- **Add Expense**: Input category, amount, and optional notes with automatic date stamping.
- **View Expenses**: Display all recorded expenses in a readable format.
- **Plot Expenses**: Generate bar and pie charts to visualize spending by category.
- **Data Storage**: Maintain expenses in a CSV file for portability and easy access.
- **Menu Interface**: Simple text‑based navigation for adding, viewing, plotting, or exiting.
